# Arduino Due Flash library

This library allows Flash memory self-programming: flash memory can be
used to store non volatile data (and can partly replace missing EEPROM
in the SAM3X CPU).

# Warning

This library is in alpha-stage.    

The API is not stable and will be changed in the coming revisions without notice.

I tried to use this library in multiwii configuration structure and found some issues in paging and addresses, so I fixed this part.

The huge effort is originally done by the original author Cristian Maglie. I only added some fixes. :)
